This repository features a command-line math calculation tool written in Python, providing support for a wide range of math functions, operators, and unit conversions.

## Using the CLI Calculator

Below is the usage tutorial:

1.  After downloading the repository, open the repository directory in the terminal.
2.  Type the following command in the terminal: `.\python-calc 'mathematical expression'`. For example, to calculate 1 + 1, type: `.\python-calc '1 + 1'`
3.  Press enter. The result will be displayed in the terminal.

Note: Make sure Python is installed on your machine before using the calculator.
